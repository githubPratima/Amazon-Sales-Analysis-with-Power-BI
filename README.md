# Amazon Sales Analysis
**About the dataset:**  We have three datasets: orders, people, and returns. The Amazon dataset spans four yearsâ€”2012 through 2015.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation using Powe Query Editor:**  During the process of cleaning and transforming the data, incorrect column headings in the people and returns datasets were rectified. Additionally, a new column named 'delivery date' was created by deriving it from the order date and ship date. The data was filtered by year based on the order date, basic cleaning procedures were performed, and categorical variables were converted to numerical values (e.g., changing 'yes' to '1').

**Data visualization to get sales performance.** Key metrics like total sales, product units, returns, and sales by segment are visualized. Identifying top and bottom-performing products aids in strategy. Power BI streamlines data management and provides real-time insights for informed decision-making, driving business growth.

**Business Needs:** The dashboard helps us understand how well Amazon is selling, find out which products and regions are doing the best or worst, spot popular items, and figure out how to make more profit. By showing us graphs and charts of sales data, it gives us the important trends we need to make smart business choices.
